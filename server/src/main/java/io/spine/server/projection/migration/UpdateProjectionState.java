/**
 * A migration operation that triggers the update of the {@link Projection} state according
 * to the logic defined in {@code onBeforeCommit()} method, if it is defined.
 *
 * <p>{@code onBeforeCommit()} is designed to contain common logic on setting
 * the calculated state fields. In a normal operational mode, it is executed after a projection
 * handles some signal and before the respective transaction is committed.
 *
 * <p>If this calculation logic is changed in the code, end-users may need to update the calculated
 * state of many projections at once. This migration operation is a straightforward way
 * to invoke the {@code onBeforeCommit()} method within a separate transaction and save the changes
 * made by it to the states of projections.
